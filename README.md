### Typical workflow (edit → push → deploy)

**1) Make your changes**

Edit files in `src/` (and/or `public/`).

**2) Run locally (optional but recommended)**

```sh
npm run dev
```

**3) Commit and push changes to main**

```sh
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "Describe your change"
git push origin main
```
**4) Build and deploy to GitHub Pages**

```sh
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
